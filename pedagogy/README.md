**3.Instructional Strategy**

Name of Instructional Strategy : Guided Inquiry

Assessment Method: As per handout

Description: of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: Brief description as per handout

**4.Task &amp; Assessment Questions:**

| **Sr. No** | **Learning Objective** | **Task to be performed by
 the student in the simulator **|** Assessment Questions as per LO &amp; Task** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | User will be able to:calculate the conductivity of different liquids | Set the voltage of the instrument, analyze the thermal conductivity of liquid |
1. Thermal conductivity is defined as the heat flow per unit time if :
  1. When the temperature gradient is unity
  2. Across the wall with no temperature
  3. Through a unit thickness of the wall
  4. **Across unit area where the temperature gradient is unity**
 |

| 2. | User will be able to:classify material on basis of conductivity | Change the liquid material with different air, water, mercury, glycerol |
1. Lowest thermal conductivity is shown by:
  1. **Air**
  2. Water
  3. Mercury
  4. Glycerol
